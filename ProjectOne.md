The present and near future have billions of devices that exist outside of the home.  The IoT "Internet of Things" refers to these devices that are all around you now, and the number of these devices will grow exponentially.  Let us look at some examples.


Home Devices.  Do you have an Echo?  A Roomba?  A smart refrigerator?  Track Lights?  Smart thermostat?  A device hooked up to your water main can tell you if you left the faucet on or your pipes are freezing, and you can shut them off when you're on vacation.  How long before all of your home lighting can be turned on by speaking? Um, yeah, that's here now.  The list will grow too.


Industrial Sensors. Manufacturers may use internet-connected sensor equipment to collect data about their other factory devices and to monitor assembly lines for potential problems. IoT sensors can help improve operational visibility, maintenance scheduling, and logistics by monitoring equipment and specific resource consumption rates.


Smart Automobiles.  These cars are connected over an IoT network called CV2X (cellular vehicle to everything) that connects vehicles and smart transport systems. Connected cars facilitate the fast transmission of data and increase drivers' response time through enhanced vehicle communication. "The investment into the autonomous vehicle industry has reached over $100 billion" as automotive manufacturers race to be the first company to release a self-driving car.  According to International Business Times


Smart Cameras.   That Ring doorbell camera you got for security?  How about the track lights that pop on when someone gets close to the yard?  Well, if you're a homeowner, chances are you already use the "IoT" to connect to many sensors.  Businesses are starting to invest significantly into internet-connected cameras that will be controlled remotely and store those recordings in safe and secure off-site locations.  It won't matter if the clerk is forced to or wants to erase the footage from a store.  The video will be stored safely somewhere else.  IoT smart cameras can leverage software that aids in recognizing intruders and weapons and sending alerts if one is detected.  No silent alarm is needed.  


Manufacturing Robots. An assembly line that sees the factory floor can make automated adjustments or be remotely controlled in case of an emergencyâ€”detecting malfunctioning parts and sending a signal to notify a supervisor.  Sensors that make robots that move avoid collisions saving precious time and money (Not to mention lives).


Healthcare.  A person with heart issues often uses smartwatches or other devices to monitor their heart rates.  Hospital devices that collect and monitor a patient's health data.   Sensors to detect if a leak of dangerous material is occurring.  Insulin pumps that help diabetes patients monitor when they need vital medication.  Soon there will even be pills that use tiny sensors to monitor reactions to drugs or detect overdoses.  


Fitness Devices.  The Peloton Cycle Exercise Bike, for example, comes with a screen that allows you to connect to real-life classes hosted by fitness trainers, giving users access to world-class instructors and allowing them to compete with other users from the comfort of home.  The Fitbit, or step devices that enable you to monitor vital stats or collect data to estimate calories burned.


Agriculture.

Do you know farms that use IoT can measure light, humidity, temperature, soil moisture, crop health have much better crop yields?  Automating farming machines has been happening for years.   The farmers can monitor the field conditions from anywhere and turn on or off irrigation so less waste and near-instant adjustments can be made to avert disaster.  


Cities.  I predict within 20 years most cities will be smart cities.  Monitoring pollution, adjusting solar panels, being alerted to gas leaks.  Understanding traffic patterns in real-time may allow for roads to automatically alert users to choose another path.  Traffic lights can be automated to notify police or medical when an accident occurs without a single person calling 911.  


I could go on and on, but I think you get the picture.  The IoT is the future.  We can't have WIFI connections every 30 feet now, can we?   We could use the traditional method, allow large telecom companies to lease land, build massive radio towers, or have neighborhoods build mini-towers (Which would still be large)  that blanket the streets.  But I think there is a better way. 

## Who is the company's intended customer?

The Company
Helium is creating one of the largest p2p networks connecting LoRa or Long Range radio waves to connect devices on a second internet, or Internet of Things.  IoT data travels over this Network to provide communication for smart devices and sensors.  Examples that actively use Helium now are Agulus, Airly, Careband, Conserv, Digital Matter, InvisiLeash, Lime, Lonestar Tracking, MyDevices, Nobel Systems, NOWi, One Planet Education Network, and Salesforce.  Saas (Software as a Service) companies are the bulk of commercial customers.  However, this will probably grow as more companies will need data transfer on the IoT.

## What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

This companies business model is decentralized. It incentivizes individuals to use their internet and electricity with a device called a helium miner.  The miner connects the Network, and as a reward, gets paid in a cryptocurrency called HNT (Helium). The miner can then trade this cryptocurrency via a cryptocurrency exchange into US dollars(Or other country's currency) or other cryptocurrencies.   The process is a unique blockchain that uses PoC or Proof of Coverage(Instead of Proof of Work or Proof of Stake).  This allows everyday people to install these devices into their own homes or offices and get paid out as a benefit instead of a large corporation leasing land and building large data towers.  I assess that the Helium Network has gone from 20,000 hot spots reserved in December 2020 to over 120,000 in July 2021.  Today they are adding 1,000 reservations a day. 

## What domain of the financial industry is the company in?

The company is using blockchain technology with a unique design.  The long-range radio waves create a network coverage similar to a cellular network.  Within the Network, there are challenges created like in a proof-of-work blockchain.  The challenges are sent over the Network to another miner somewhere in the Network, which solves the challenge.  Each step in this process creates HNT for the miners involved.

Results

What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing based on these metrics?

As the IoT Space is relatively new, traditional methods of Profitability, Liquidity, Asset Turnover Ratios, and Financial Leverage Ratios may be outdated.

Profitability in the "IoT" is mainly non-existent, much like Amazon.com was not profitable for years.

We could measure how much money has been spent to capture the market share, but this too is difficult to determine. Just because a company gets money to develop doesn't mean its development will lead to better market share. 

My best guess at Metric in this space is as follows.

1. % of devices "Up."
2. Active users
3. Value Added to Community

% of devices "Up"
Helium Network in January 2021 had 20,000 hotspot Miners connected and running.
Helium Network, as of now, has 131,390 hotspot Miners connected and running, adding approx 1,000 a day.  Each one can range from 800 meters to 2.5km.  (Depending on topography and other factors)

I have including a map of just the United States & Pheonix Metro Area as an example.

1. [Us Hotspot Map](https://jwiseole.imgbb.com/)
2. [Pheonix Metro Hotspot Map](https://ibb.co/t2WFqqt)

% of Devices Increased

A 600%+ increase in 8 months shows explosive growth in a short time.  The increase seems to be accelerating.  

# Active Users.

With the current chip shortage, the miners cannot be built fast enough.  Wait time for a Helium miner purchased today is roughly 4 months.  Meaning some customers have purchased a miner that will be going online when received.  Social media accounts are buzzing with new companies starting to build these devices, but it cannot happen fast enough for the demand.  I don't have numbers for back-ordered units(The Device manufactures are not releasing those numbers.), but I would guess it's in the hundreds of thousands.

List of Companies that manufacture the devices.  (All Backordered)
1. Bobcat
2. Cal-Chip
3. ClodPi
4. FreedomFi
5. FXTec Linxdot
6. Kerlink
7. LongAP
8. Nebra
9. Pisces/ Green Palm Technologies
10. RAK Wireless
11. Sensecap
12. Syncrobit


Value added to Community.

There is no doubt that the value added to customers would be immense. A cheaper Long-range radio wave, wide area network (LoRaWAN) dispersed over a large area of US (and internationally) urban centers can cut costs. Incentivizing more people to place these devices in their homes or offices seems as easy as word of mouth.  When most people find out they can make a few hundred dollars a month just by placing this device in their home at today's prices, let alone if the price of Helium goes up and the HNT is not sold that month, 100-200$ could be worth thousands.    


Suggestions

With the unique space this company is in, and it's hard to determine how it will grow compared to the giant telecommunications companies and other tech leaders such as Amazon, which have a significant investment in this space.  

I suggest they spend significantly more money on advertising as I have seen very little about this company on mainstream media. I.e., Television networks, radio stations, and print media.  They can leverage the idea of helping the everyday man instead of just leasing swaths of land and building giant towers.  They could focus on the environmentally friendly nature of the concept, sharing profits versus adding to a company's bottom line and building a better community by connecting a network.    

Another suggestion is to invest in the infrastructure of their manufactures.  Helium miners are backlogged on orders of their original hotspot miners, for which demand is exponentialâ€”making more agreements with more third-party manufacturers or hiring a workforce dedicated to this goal, or building facilities under the direct control of the company.
